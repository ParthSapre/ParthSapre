Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a frontend developer who's been working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a while now.
While I love designing and building user interfaces, I'm also eager to expand my skill set and learn more about backend development.

Recently, I've been diving into technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to gain a better understanding of server-side programming and database management. 
I'm excited to apply what I've learned to create more dynamic and interactive web applications.

In addition to coding, I enjoy collaborating with other developers and learning from their experiences.
I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer, and I'm excited to see where my journey into backend development takes me.
